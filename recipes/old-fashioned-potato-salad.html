        <p>There are many ways to make potato salad, but if you're looking for a traditional, mayonnaise-based potato salad made with hard-boiled eggs, celery, and a little pickle relish for zing, you've landed on the right recipe. Very easy to make using everyday ingredients.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>¼ cup mayonnaise </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon prepared mustard </li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
